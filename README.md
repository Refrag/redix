Redix v5
========
> a simple, flixble and scriptable `key - value` datastorage system that speaks redis but not limited to redis commands, `redix` doesn't focus on where it store its data, but on how we interact with our data, it only uses redis serialization protocol (RESP) for compatibility with the current redis clients.
